          <blockquote>
            <p>"It's almost like it's your ideal receiver. It's like he's a created player on 'Madden,' when you put his overall 99. He's got the fastest speed on there, and the strength and everything is maximized to another level. All of those things make him stand out even more. He's a massive receiver who can run, who can catch and who can block."</p>
